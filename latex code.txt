\chapter{INTRODUCTION}
{\largeThe Evolution of e-commerce and digital transactions has led to a significant transformation in the way goods and services are bought and sold. Traditional auction systems, once limited by geography and physical presence, are now being replaced by dynamic, web-based bidding platforms that offer greater accessibility, scalability, and efficiency. In this digital age, there is a growing demand for secure, transparent, and real-time auction environments that can cater to a wide range of users—buyers, sellers, and administrators alike.

BidWise addresses this demand by providing a modern, feature-rich online bidding platform that enables users to participate in real-time auctions seamlessly. Designed with both usability and security in mind, BidWise allows sellers to list items with defined auction parameters, while buyers can browse active listings, place competitive bids, and track auctions as they unfold. The system ensures fairness and transparency through features like real-time bid updates, user authentication, bid history tracking, and automated auction expiration handling.

Built using a robust tech stack—ReactJS for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database—BidWise leverages modern web technologies to deliver a responsive and secure auction experience. Core functionalities such as automated commission tracking, secure login, payment verification, and admin dashboards are integrated to provide end-to-end auction management.

Through BidWise, this project aims to digitize and enhance the traditional auction process by incorporating real-time interactivity, data integrity, and intuitive user experience. It bridges the gap between conventional marketplace practices and next-generation digital commerce, offering a reliable platform for users across diverse domains.}


\chapter{SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE}
{\largeThe architecture of BidWise is meticulously crafted to support modularity, scalability, and real-time responsiveness, while ensuring a secure and user-friendly auction experience. At its core, the system is structured into three primary layers: the Presentation Layer, the Application and Business Logic Layer, and the Data and Persistence Layer. The Presentation Layer, built using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS, delivers a dynamic and responsive interface for users to interact with auctions, manage profiles, and track bidding activity. The Application Logic Layer, developed with Node.js and Express.js, orchestrates the core functionalities such as user authentication, bid handling, auction management, and administrative workflows. The Data Layer, powered by MongoDB, handles all persistent storage requirements including user data, auction listings, bid histories, and commission records. This layered architecture not only promotes separation of concerns but also allows for future scalability, integration of new modules, and seamless maintenance. Real-time bid updates and auction state transitions are supported through efficient API communication, ensuring high performance and system integrity across all operations.}

\section{Overview}
{\largeThe architecture of BidWise follows a robust client-server model, where the frontend (client) is developed using ReactJS and styled with Tailwind CSS for a responsive and intuitive user experience. The backend server is built using Node.js with Express.js, facilitating seamless communication between the client and the server. All interactions between the frontend and backend occur through RESTful APIs, ensuring platform independence and enabling smooth integration of additional features or third-party services in the future. The system’s backend also incorporates essential middleware for authentication, authorization, and error handling, ensuring secure and reliable operations. Data is persistently stored and managed using MongoDB, allowing for flexible and scalable handling of auctions, user profiles, bids, and commission records. The modular design of the platform makes it maintainable and extensible, supporting the long-term evolution of the project into a comprehensive digital marketplace solution.}  

\section{System Components}
\subsection{Frontend (Reactjs)}
{\large The frontend of BidWise is designed to provide an engaging, seamless, and responsive interface that caters to the diverse needs of auction participants, including both bidders and sellers. Developed using ReactJS, a powerful library for building dynamic user interfaces, the frontend emphasizes intuitive navigation, real-time updates, and ease of use across all modern devices—desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

Key features of the frontend include:}
\begin{itemize}
     \item A home dashboard that highlights ongoing, upcoming, and featured auctions..
    \item Auction listing pages where users can view item details, current highest bids, and auction countdowns.
    \item A bidding interface that allows users to place and view bids in real-time.
    \item Authentication forms (Sign Up/Login) for both users and administrators.
    \item Interactive notifications using react-toastify for alerts on bid updates, errors, or auction conclusions.
    \item Smooth routing and navigation powered by React Router.
\end{itemize}
{\large React handles state management and routing internally and communicates with the backend using asynchronous HTTP requests (e.g., via Axios or Fetch API).}

\subsection{Backend (Node.js + Express + MongoDB)}
{\large The backend of BidWise is developed using Node.js with the Express.js framework, providing a fast, scalable, and lightweight environment for handling asynchronous server-side operations. It manages all core functionalities of the platform, including auction creation, bidding logic, authentication, user management, commission verification, and automated auction closure.

Key backend functionalities include:}

\begin{itemize}
    \item /api/users/: For user registration, login, profile management, and role-based access (user/admin).

    \item /api/auctions/: To create new auctions, view active and upcoming auctions, and manage auction items.
    \item /api/bids/: Enables placing bids, fetching current highest bids, and maintaining bid history.

    \item /api/commissions/: Handles commission submissions, verification, and proof uploads.

    \item /api/admin/: Super admin routes to manage platform-wide operations and verify payments.

    \item Cron jobs (endedAuctionCron.js, verifyCommissionCron.js) automate the closure of expired auctions and track unpaid commissions.
\end{itemize}

{\large Security and middleware features:}
\begin{itemize}

    \item JWT authentication ensures secure access to protected routes.

    \item Input validation prevents malformed requests and data tampering.

    \item Custom middleware for error handling, logging, and tracking auction status in real-time.

    \item Role-based authorization restricts admin and user functionalities appropriately..
\end{itemize}
\section{Deployment Considerations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Web Server: The Node.js backend can be deployed using PM2 or Node’s native cluster module, often served behind a Nginx reverse proxy for better scalability and performance.

    \item Database: MongoDB Atlas or self-hosted MongoDB instances can be used to store auction items, bids, user data, and commission records efficiently in a flexible NoSQL format.

    \item Cloud Hosting: Cloud platforms like Render, Vercel (for frontend), Heroku, AWS EC2, or DigitalOcean can be used to deploy both frontend and backend applications for global access.

    \item Security: The platform enforces HTTPS encryption, JWT-based authentication, input validation, rate-limiting, and CORS policies to protect against common vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, and brute-force attacks.

    \item Environment Management: Environment variables are stored securely using .env files, and platform-specific secrets management tools (e.g., Heroku Config Vars, AWS Secrets Manager) can be used in production.
\end{itemize}

\section{Scalability and Extensibility}
{\large The modular and well-structured architecture of BidWise is designed with scalability and future enhancements in mind. Each component—frontend, backend, and database—operates independently yet cohesively, allowing seamless upgrades and feature expansion. Additional functionalities such as:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-role access controls (e.g., moderators, admins, bidders, sellers),

    \item Real-time bidding and auction updates via WebSockets,

    \item Integration of payment gateways and escrow services,

    \item Analytics dashboards for user behavior and bidding trends,

    \item Multi-language and region-specific support
\end{itemize}

{\large can be incorporated without affecting the core functionalities or existing user data.}

{\large In summary, the BidWise system architecture not only supports current auction processes effectively but also lays a flexible and robust foundation for evolving into a more advanced digital marketplace. This foresight enables the platform to adapt to increasing user demand, feature complexity, and technological evolution with minimal friction.}
